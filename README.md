## About

This is one of the projects required to obtain the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

This project has an academic objective in order to consolidate my knowledge in HTML and CSS.

In this project, it was requested to create a survey to collect data from users.
The project model was free to choose, so I chose the cinema theme for this project.
